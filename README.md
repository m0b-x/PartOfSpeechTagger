# Project Description

### Part of Speech Tagging 

Part of speech tagging is the action of assigning a part of speech to a word based on an algorithm.

### Goal of the Project

This project is a **part of speech tagger** that aims to enhance the **global probability method** with **trust coefficient** and **static tagging rules**.

As shown below, the program shows promising results, is scalable and is fast. More about the project can be found here:

# Training and Testing Data

### Brown Corpus

For both training and testing data, I have chosen to use the **Brown Corpus**. The Brown Corpus is a linguistic resource used for research in natural language processing and corpus linguistics.
The file contains split sentences, each word having a codified part of speech assigned to it:

```
This/dt has/hvz been/ben a/at working/vbg session/nn of/in an/at organization/nn that/wps ,/, by/in its/pp$ very/ap nature/nn ,/, can/md only/rb proceed/vb along/in its/pp$ route/nn step/nn by/in step/nn and/cc without/in dramatic/jj changes/nns ./.
In/in Oslo/np ,/, the/at ministers/nns have/hv met/vbn in/in a/at climate/nn of/in candor/nn ,/, and/cc made/vbn a/at genuine/jj attempt/nn to/to get/vb information/nn and/cc understanding/vbg one/pn another's/dt$ problems/nns ./.
```

### Training and Testing Percentage

I will be using 80% data for training and 20% data for testing.
